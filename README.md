# RPL DIS Attack Simulation

This repository contains source code for motes to run on Contiki Cooja simulator, simulating RPL networks with normal behaviour and with different DIS attack scenarios.

## Node Types

The project consists of three types of nodes:

1. **Root Node** (`rpl-root/`): The DODAG root that manages the RPL network
2. **Client Node** (`rpl-client/`): Regular RPL nodes that participate in the network
3. **Malicious Client Node** (`rpl-malicious-client/`): Modified client nodes that perform DIS attacks

## Implementation Details

Contiki-NG provides two implementations of RPL with different attributes:

- RPL Classic
- RPL Lite (a lite implementation with non-storing mode)

For this project, we use the RPL Lite implementation as it's more suitable for our research scope. The implementation is based on Contiki's open-source code:

- Client node code is copied from `os/net/routing/rpl-lite/rpl-icmp6.c` to `rpl-client/rpl-icmp6.c`
- Root node code is copied from `os/net/routing/rpl-lite/rpl-dag-root.c` to `rpl-root/rpl-dag-root.c`

The malicious node implementation is based on the client node code (since the attacker will be a client node), with the attack logic implementation added in `rpl-malicious-client/main.c`.

## Analysis Tools

The `analyzers/` directory contains scripts in JS used to analyze the logs generated by the motes and extract relevant data for research purposes.
